UAM stands for Universal AutoMarker. It is a framework for testing
student assignments written in a variety of programming languages,
collecting the results, and exporting them for easy viewing using
templates.

We currently provide support for Python (pam) and Java (jam).

We are working on supporting SQL (sqam) and Racket (ram).

We welcome collaboration and contributions! Next on our list is
Haskell (ham).

REQUIREMENTS:

You need Python >= 3.3 installed on your system. Then, install the
requirements listed in the file requirements.txt. The easiest way to
do this is to use pip (pip for Python 3):

pip install -r /path_to_uam/requirements.txt

You can use virtualenv to avoid installing the packages system-wide
(https://virtualenv.pypa.io).


To use JAM, you also need Java >= 7 installed in your system.

USAGE:

The top level directory contains the framework scripts (test runner,
aggregator, and templator). The pam directory contains the Python
AutoMarker with instructions and examples, and the jam directory
contains the Java AutoMarker with instructions and examples.

See README files for pam and jam for specific instructions.
